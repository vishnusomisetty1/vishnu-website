        <p className="mb-4">I'm 14 years old, and sometimes I feel like people don't see how hard I work or what I can do. I feel small on my basketball team because I'm short, and I think I could be smarter if I tried harder. I like Boy Scouts, but not everyone trusts me there. I know I need to grow and get better, and I believe I can. Even though people don't always notice what I've done, I know what I've achieved. I got higher ranks in Boy Scouts, made my basketball team even though I'm only 4'11, and learned to speak Telugu. I need to stay positive but also face my problems and not run away from them.</p>
        <p className="ml-4 mb-4">Fear can slow me down. I worry about letting my parents down or not getting good grades. But I know I need to face those fears. I can talk to my family or tutors if I need help, and I'll grow stronger by doing that. I want to grow by learning new things. One thing I want to learn is coding. Even though I don't like it, I know it's important. I'll take online classes and practice a lot. A MacBook could help me with this. I also want to do well in school and learn about U.S. history by reading books and watching movies. This will help me understand things better.</p>
        <p className="ml-4 mb-4">Who Am I? I don't even know the answer to that question. I definitely am not proud of what I have accomplished yet. I honestly was never happy about myself in my entire life. I do not know why, when I made these videos and actually finished the challenge, I have no idea why I felt like this was the first time I finished something and went through the end with it. After finishing my last video and Harsha saying it was good, I felt a different kind of happiness, feeling satisfaction and completion. With this, I also feel like I need to prove myself to everyone. I have no instances where I feel like the people around me are actually proud of me. If I look into my memories, there is not one time in my life where I feel like my family is proud of me. I want to have the ability to do this one day. After all the things they have done for me, I need to prove who I really can be. This is a question that will take me years to answer, I need to realize who I really am. I will one day make everyone proud that I am who I am. One thing I also dislike is everyone worried about how I will become. Everyone being worried also makes me worried about myself and all of the people around me. That is one of the goals I have, for everyone to stop worrying about how I am right now. Making these videos showed me that there is nothing I need to worry about yet.</p>
